Synthesis of Co−P Nanocomposites. Co−P nanocomposites were fabricated following the previous literature with slight modiﬁcations. In detail, 1.2 mmol of Co(ac)2 was mixed with 2.4 mmol of TPP and 21 mL of OM in a 100 mL three-necked ﬂask. The mixture was heated to 110 °C for 30 min under an argon ﬂow to exclude the water as well as oxygen, and then heated up to 290 °C for 3 h. Co−P nanocomposites were obtained after centrifugation of the black solution while it was cooled down to room temperature. Then Co−P nanocomposites were washed with a mixed solution of cyclohexane, acetone, and ethanol several times and dispersed in 30 mL of cyclohexane. 
Catalyst Synthesis. ZnFe2O4 was prepared according to the previously reported method. CuOx-decorated ZnFe2O4 was prepared by replacing some of the Zn ions with Cu ions. All of the analytic reagents were dissolved with deionized water. Typically, a NaBH4 solution was dropwise added to a mixed solution of Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, and Zn(NO3)2 ([Fe3+]/[NaBH4] = 1:2). After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 12 h in an autoclave tube. The solid product was washed with deionized water and ﬁnally dried at 60 °C overnight. The samples prepared with different Cu/Zn mole ratios (1:9, 3:7, 5:5, and 7:3) were designated as ZnFe2O4−Cu1, ZnFe2O4−Cu3, ZnFe2O4−Cu5, and ZnFe2O4−Cu7. As a reference, Cu−Fe composite oxide (designated as Cu−Fe−O) was prepared in the absence of Zn(NO3)2 ([Cu2+]/[Fe3+] = 1:2)
In a typical synthetic procedure, the composite microspheres of pyrite and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were ﬁrst synthesized, brieﬂy, 0.556 g of FeSO4·7H2O and 0.6 g of PVP-K30 were dissolved in 20 mL of ethylene glycol in a 100 mL round-bottomed ﬂask. Then 0.128 g of S powder was dispersed in the solution by ultrasonication for a few minutes. The round-bottomed ﬂask was equipped on the microwave reactor for reaction of 30 min under nitrogen ﬂow at 80% of the full power, and a black precipitate was obtained. The dried black precipitate was then calcined in air at 900 °C for 10 min, with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, a red powder was obtained and collected for further characterizations. 
Synthesis of GO and Na3V2(PO4)3. GO was prepared by an improved Hummers course. The resultant GO dispersion underwent dialysis (room temperature, 14 days) and rotary evaporation (60 °C) to remove suitable water. The concentration of the ﬁnal GO dispersion adopted is 5.24 mg mL−1. In a typical synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), NH4VO3 (2 mmol) and oxalic acid (8.4 mmol) were added in 80 mL of water at 80 °C. After stirring for 1 h, the above GO dispersion was added into the mixture under sonication for 0.5 h. Then Na2CO3 (1.5 mmol) and NH4H2PO4 (3 mmol) were added under agitation for 36 h. The resultant product was precalcined at 350 °C for 3 h under an N2 atmosphere, followed by the powder produced being calcined at 700 °C for 10 h in H2−Ar mixture with 5% H2 (v/v)
CuInSe2 Nanocrystal Synthesis. CIS nanocrystals were synthesized using a modiﬁcation of published procedures. In a typical reaction, 2 mmol of CuCl, 2 mmol of InCl3, 4 mmol of Se, and 20 mL of degassed oleylamine are added to a 100 mL three-neck ﬂask inside an N2 ﬁlled glovebox. The ﬂask is attached to a standard Schlenk line and degassed at 110 °C under a vacuum for 45 min. The ﬂask is then ﬁlled with nitrogen and heated to 200 °C. After 30 min, the temperature is raised to 260 °C. After 10 min, the heating mantle is removed and the reaction is allowed to cool to room temperature. The nanocrystals are washed via centrifugation using toluene and ethanol as the solvent and antisolvent, respectively. Poorly capped nanocrystals are then separated from the toluene solution via centrifugation. The ﬁnal nanocrystal dispersion is then transferred to a glovebox for the ligand exchange. 
Synthesis of PEI-PTMC. PTMC20k-COOH (4.0 g, 0.2 mmol) and DCC (4.1 g, 20 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of dried DMF and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Then PEI25K (5.0 g, 0.2 mmol) and DMAP (0.27 g, 2 mmol) were added to the above solution. The solution was kept stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting mixture was ﬁltered, and the ﬁltrate was dialyzed (MWCO = 30000 Da) against distilled water for 48 h then lyophilized to obtain PEI-PTMC.
Synthesis of PEG-DA. mPEG2k-NH2 (400 mg, 0.2 mmol) and DA (276 mg, 2 mmol) in 20 mL of PBS (pH 8.0) was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Then the solution was dialyzed (MWCO = 1000 Da) against distilled water at neutral pH for 24 h and lyophilized to obtain PEG-DA. 
Synthesis of LiMgxCuyCo1−x−yO2, was carried out by mixing stoichiometric amounts of Li(COOCH3)2·2H2O, Co(COOCH3)2·4H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and Mg(COOCH3)2·4H2O and dissolving in minimum quantity of triple distilled water. The resulting solution was concentrated by stirring continuously at 100°C. Thus concentrated solution was transferred to a silica crucible and placed at the centre of the rotating plate of a microwave oven (Kenstar, India 2450 MHz, 800 W). The solution was irradiated at 100% power for 15−25 minutes. During the reaction, the acetates and nitrates were quickly burnt and a red glow appears inside the silica crucible throughout the reaction. After irradiation the product was ground for few hours to obtain phase pure LiMgxCuyCo1−x−yO2.
